# web-application-firewall-WAF-
A WAF is a network security device that protects web applications from attacks.

The code provided is a basic Flask web application that includes functionality to blacklist specific IPs, URLs, and User Agents and prevent access from these blacklisted entities. Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. Import necessary modules:
   - `re`: Regular expression module for URL pattern matching.
   - `Flask`: The Flask framework for building web applications.
   - `request`: Used for accessing the incoming HTTP request.
   - `abort`: Used to abort the request and return an HTTP error response.

2. Create a Flask web application instance:

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```

3. Define three lists to hold blacklisted IPs, URLs, and User Agents. These lists are initially empty and need to be populated with the entities you want to blacklist.

```python
blacklisted_ips = []
blacklisted_urls = []
blacklisted_user_agents = []
```

4. Define functions to check if an IP, URL, or User Agent is blacklisted:

   - `is_blacklisted_ip(ip)`: Checks if the given IP address is in the `blacklisted_ips` list.
   - `is_blacklisted_url(url)`: Iterates through the `blacklisted_urls` list and uses regular expressions to check if the given URL matches any of the blacklisted patterns.
   - `is_blacklisted_user_agent(user_agent)`: Checks if the given User Agent string is in the `blacklisted_user_agents` list.

5. Define a function `is_malicious_request(request)` to determine if a request is malicious:

   - Extract the IP address, URL, and User Agent from the incoming HTTP request object.
   - Check if any of these elements are blacklisted using the functions defined in step 4. If any of them are blacklisted, the function returns `True`, indicating a malicious request.

6. Define a main route at the root URL ("/") that handles both GET and POST requests. Inside this route, the code checks if the request is malicious using the `is_malicious_request` function. If it's a malicious request, a 403 (Forbidden) HTTP error response is returned. Otherwise, a "Hello, World!" message is returned.

7. Start the Flask application if the script is run directly:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

To use this code effectively, you need to populate the `blacklisted_ips`, `blacklisted_urls`, and `blacklisted_user_agents` lists with the entities you want to blacklist. For example, you can add specific IPs, URL patterns, or User Agents that you want to block from accessing your application.

Keep in mind that this code is a basic example and may not cover all aspects of web security. Depending on your use case, you might need to implement additional security measures and consider more advanced techniques for mitigating potential threats.
